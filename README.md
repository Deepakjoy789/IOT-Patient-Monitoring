# In is an project of  an IoT based health monitoring system using ESP32 Microcontroller with built in WiFi and Bluetooth to display health data such as:

# Patient body Temperature,
# Patient Blood Oxygen(SPo2),
# Patient Heart rate,
# Room Temperature
# Room Humidity
# and more (optional).

# As the technology in the IoT industry improving every day with new inventions of health monitoring devices, It is becoming easy to monitor few health parameters easily at our home itself, So if any abnormal things happens we can immediately take some action against it by visiting a nearest clinic or doctor.
# It is important to monitor some important health parameters like body temperature, heart rate and Blood Oxygen levels as they may indicate a precaution before any illness.

# So, in our IoT project we are interfacing few sensors with ESP32 Microcontroller such as DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor to measure body temperature, MAX30100 heart rate and Pulse Oximeter sensor module to measure Blood SpO2 and Heart rate, BME280 temperature and humidity sensor to measure the room temperature and humidity as these parameters sometimes makes a person feel uncomfortable.
